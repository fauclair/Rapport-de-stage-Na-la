  abstract = {Fluid dynamics is fundamental to our understanding of the atmosphere and oceans. Although many of the same principles of fluid dynamics apply to both the atmosphere and oceans, textbooks tend to concentrate on the atmosphere, the ocean, or the theory of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). This textbook provides a comprehensive unified treatment of atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics. The book introduces the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics, including rotation and stratification, vorticity and potential vorticity, and scaling and approximations. It discusses baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, wave-mean flow interactions and turbulence, and the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. Student problems and exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics: Fundamentals and Large-Scale Circulation will be an invaluable graduate textbook on advanced courses in GFD, meteorology, atmospheric science and oceanography, and an excellent review volume for researchers.

  abstract = {Oceanic motions with spatial scales of 200 m--20 km, called submesoscales, are ubiquitous in the upper ocean and serve as a key intermediary between larger-scale balanced dynamics and unbalanced turbulence. Here, we introduce the fluid dynamics of submesoscales and contrast them with motions at larger and smaller scales. We summarize the various ways in which submesoscales develop due to instabilities that extract potential or kinetic energy from larger-scale balanced currents; some instabilities have counterparts at larger scales, while others are distinct to the submesoscale regime. Submesoscales modify the density stratification in the upper ocean and redistribute energy between scales. These energy transfers are complex, having both up-scale and down-scale components. Submesoscale eddies and fronts also contribute to a spatially heterogeneous distribution of shear and restratification that leave an imprint on upper ocean turbulence. The impact of submesoscales on the Earth's climate remains an exciting research frontier.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional, vertical section of the Strait of Gibraltar is simulated numerically with the nonhydrostatic/ non-Boussinesq three-dimensional CROCO model to investigate details of small-scale dynamics. The proposed configuration is simple, computationally efficient and incorporates the configuration of sills characteristic of this region. Despite the shortcomings of a 2D representation, this configuration provides a realistic depiction of small-scale mechanisms in the strait during a typical tidal cycle: internal solitary waves generation and propagation, occurrence of hydraulic controls and hydraulic jumps at the sills and presence of active turbulent patches. In particular, the well-known eastward propagation of large amplitude internal waves is assessed using the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) propagation model for solitary waves.},

The full set of compressible Navier--Stokes equations is integrated for a free-surface ocean with three time-steps respectively associated to the internal, external and compressible (non Boussinesq) modes. The resulting three-mode algorithm can be implemented either in a fully compressible configuration or in a ``pseudo-compressible'' configuration by artificially lowering acoustic-wave velocities to reduce computational costs. The present description of the three-mode algorithm focuses in the first place on the simulation of non-hydrostatic processes in free-surface ocean models.},
